# ELearning Reverse Engineering

## Problem Statement

Bicocca's eLearning platform is built on Moodle, a widely-used learning management system.

Unlike proprietary applications, Moodle is fully open source, meaning its codebase is publicly available for inspection and analysis.

## Solution Architecture

No reverse engineering is required.

- The official Moodle mobile app source code is available at [moodlehq/moodleapp](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodleapp).
- API documentation and developer resources can be found in the [Moodle Developer Documentation](https://moodledev.io/).
